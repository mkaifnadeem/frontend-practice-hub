> _“CSS is not just about making things look good — it’s about making them feel right.”_

Welcome to the CSS Fundamentals section of the **Frontend Practice Hub**!  
This module is your hands-on guide to mastering the core concepts of modern CSS.

## 📁 Structure

`01_vanilla-css/`  
✨ Projects and exercises using pure (vanilla) CSS. Covers all main topics:

- Selectors & specificity
- Box model & layout (`Flexbox`, `Grid`)
- Typography & colors
- Responsive design & media queries
- Animations, transitions, and more!

`02_sass/`  
🛠️ Introduction to SASS (`Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets`).  
_Note: Only 2–3 projects here for now. Full SASS and advanced workflow will be covered after JavaScript._

`03_tailwind/`  
🚀 Mini-projects using the `Tailwind CSS` utility framework.  
_Note: Tailwind will also be explored in greater depth after the JavaScript section._

## 🚦 Learning Roadmap

`1. Start with Vanilla CSS:`  
Build a strong foundation by completing all exercises and projects in the `01_vanilla-css` folder.

`2. Try SASS & Tailwind (Optional Previews):`  
Dip your toes in with a couple of sample projects in `02_sass` and `03_tailwind`.

`3. Full SASS & Tailwind Courses:`  
After mastering JavaScript (see `03-javascript`), revisit SASS and Tailwind for advanced workflows and real-world projects.

## 💡 Why This Order?

- `CSS first:` Core styling and layout skills are essential for any frontend dev.
- `SASS & Tailwind after JS:` These tools shine in large projects, which often need dynamic JS and frameworks (`React`, `Vue`, etc.).
- `You’ll be ready for anything:` This progression ensures you understand the “why” behind every style you write.
